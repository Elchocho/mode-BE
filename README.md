## Statement of Purpose

Coding and developing is so much fun.  
But at times it can also get tedious, tiring or even stressful. Work-related mental health issues and anxieties are not uncommon among tech companies.  
According to the Stack Overflow 2018 survey, mental health issues like depression and anxiety are common amongst the respondents.  
The largest percentage reported a mood or emotional disorder. It is slowly coming out of the taboo corner to talk about these issues.  
I understand what it feels like to be under such pressure and it's great to be able to reflect.  
Looking around me, there are a lot of people still struggling and not knowing how to deal with these issues.  
I hope this app will help them a little bit.

## Project Status

Project is: _in progress_  
At the moment of writing the mode app is useable.  
I'm still developing the app and I'm trying new technologies to improve the code and the UI.  
To make it more appealing to developers, I plan to implement more coding related subjects.
Get in touch with me if you have anything fun to add!
